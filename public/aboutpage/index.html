                    <h4>Union of European Football Association</h4>
                    <p>
                        The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL, or sometimes, UEFA CL) is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs, 
                        deciding the competition winners through a round robin group stage to qualify for a double-legged knockout format, and a single leg final. 
                        It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, 
                        behind only the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, 
                        played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.

                    <h4>Trophy of the Champions League</h4>
                    <p>
                        Each year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, 
                        the current version of which has been awarded since 1967. 
                        From the 1968-69 season and prior to the 2008-09 season any team that won the Champions League three years in a row or five times overall was awarded the official trophy permanently.
                        Each time a club achieved this, a new official trophy had to be forged for the following season.
                        Five clubs own a version of the official trophy: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan and Liverpool.
                        Since 2008, the official trophy has remained with UEFA and the clubs are awarded a replica.
